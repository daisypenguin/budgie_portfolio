	<h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
	<p>Characteristics of wild budgies
	<ul>
	<li>18 cm (7 in) long
	<li>weigh 30–40 grams (1.1–1.4 oz)
	<li>average wingspan of 30 cm
	<li>a light green body colour (abdomen and rumps)
	<li>mantles (back and wing coverts)
	<li> pitch-black mantle markings (blackish in fledgelings and immatures) edged in clear yellow undulations
	<li>forehead and face yellow in adults but with blackish stripes down to the cere (nose) in young individuals
	<li>small, iridescent blue-violet cheek patches
	<li>three black spots across each side of their throats (called throat patches)
	<li>two outermost throat spots are situated at the base of each cheek patch
	<li>tail is cobalt (dark-blue)
	<li>outside tail feathers display central yellow flashes
	<li>wings have greenish-black flight feathers and black coverts with yellow fringes along with central yellow flashes, which only become visible in flight or when the wings are outstretched
	<li>bills are olive grey and legs blueish-grey, with zygodactyl toes.
	</ul>
	<p>Budgerigars in their natural habitat in Australia are noticeably smaller than those in captivity.[citation needed] This particular parrot species has been bred in many other colours and shades in captivity (e.g. blue, grey, grey-green, pieds, violet, white, yellow-blue), although they are mostly found in pet stores in blue, green, and yellow. Like most parrot species, budgerigar plumage fluoresces under ultraviolet light. This phenomenon is possibly related to courtship and mate selection.</p>
