This is a website created from scratch about budgerigars. This was the capstone project for the completion of the 'Web design for everybody' course by University of Michigan on Coursera.
This is a responsive website for 3 platforms. Everypage has a header, navigation bar to navigate to the other pages and a footer. There is a gallery of pictures which can be viewed as a carousel at the user's convenience and an incorporated plugin for Google calender.
Each page validates  at validator.w3.org.
