Also, they don't bite and even if they do sometime, it is not harmful. These tiny cute birds will melt your heart and make you happy in no time. So, what are you waiting for? Go get a budgie and make your life wonderful as heaven.</p>
	<h2>I had 3 budgerigars at home and now I have got 10. Want to know how? :) </h2>
	<p>Budgie breeding is a relatively easy process but requires experience gained overtime. However, most of the budgerigars bred at home cannot reproduce themselves due to the lack of space. The budgie breeding period is about 4 years for females and 6 years for males, and they shouldn’t be paired until they have 10-11 months. The female lays 5-6 eggs within 2 days, and the incubation period lasts 18 days.
	For budgie breeding stimulation provide the budgies with a lot of light for about 12 hours per day. Natural light is ideal, but the light entering into your home is not sufficient for the metabolization of vitamin D. That is why you should use a supplementary source of light such as a fluorescent lamp with a large spectrum. Just place a nest in the cage and plenty of food and calcium and watch nature do its job :)</p>
	<!--The nest and nutrition

A Cage nest is necessary because it is there the budgerigar breeding act is made. Therefore, you should have at least 2 solid nests to sustain the budgie female in order for her to feel comfortable and in balance when the budgie male comes over her.

Nutrition is extremely beneficial for budgie breeding. The most decisive factor that determines the correct development of a budgerigar parakeet is feeding. If budgies have proper nutrition and a proper environment, they can develop healthy, and their features are exclusively transmitted from generation to generation through their genes. A budgie breeding nest is usually made of plywood and the bottom of the cage should have a recess where the female will lay eggs.

 Budgie Mating – behavior within the reproduction period

At first, the two birds might ignore themselves, but as time passes they will bond, forming a true pair. In the case that this has happened, you will notice that the mates are staying close to one another on the perches inside the bird cage.  They will eat together, clean one another, and finally mate. The budgie female within her breeding period will search for proper places to lay eggs and will place herself on the nest with lifted tail and her wings easily opened. On the other hand, the budgie male who is ready for mating will dance for his mate in order to steal her attention.
Assurance of optimal conditions

Budgie mating season usually starts in spring and ends in autumn. Still, if you provide them the necessary conditions they can reproduce any time of the year.

The budgie mating diet is very important, and it should be as healthy and balanced as possible not only during the reproduction period, but within the budgie’s whole life. The ideal diet is to provide 2-3 months of diverse foods  a diverse foods containing a high level of proteins and vitamins before the budgerigar breeding.

Daily baths are also hugely valuable because they will stimulate the budgies to mate. It is preferably is to maintain a bathtub filled with water permanently inside the cage.

 

The cage must be as large and big as it can be in order to offer sufficient space to the budgies for the comfortable process of budgie mating. The budgie breeding nest can either be bought from pet stores or made by yourself from plywood or thick cardboard.

 
Budgie Breeding-laying eggs, hatching

If everything goes well and the budgie breeding has happened, the female will start to lay eggs in 8-10 days after she is accommodated with the nest. Below are some signs that the moment of laying eggs is coming:

    the female will spend most of the time in the nest and will mostly feed from the cuttlefish and the mineral block;
    the budgerigar parakeet female will arrange and rearrange the layer from the nest;
    12-24 hours before laying eggs the female’s cloaca will be swollen.

The budgie eggs: the budgerigar parakeet chickens will come out exactly 18 days after being laid from the budgie female, who will take care of the hatching. If within those 18 days the eggs have not hatched, remove them because they can cause misunderstandings between the mates.

 

The budgie breeding nest will only be visited by the father and in some situations not even he will have access unless he brings food to his mate or if she gives her approval. Generally, you should provide proteins and vitamins. Bristle grass should not be missing from their food: cow cheese or boiled chicken egg are recommended.

 
The newborn chicks

The chicks: Newborn chicks are very fragile, have closed eyes, long necks and cannot sustain their heads. The budgie female and male will not feed them for several hours after they are born, but they have nutrient supplies from their own egg. The owners must constantly check that the chicks healthy. After a few days, the chick must have a brilliant colour, and they must feel consistent when they are taken in hand. A lighter chick is more disposed to illnesses. Before the appearance of feathers, you can see inside the crop due to thin skin. A chick that has a full crop means that it is well-fed and healthy in most cases.

 

After the feathers appear and reach the size of 1 cm they must be solid and sturdy to the touch. Chicks can be left until the next note that parents feed themselves or their parents pinch as they prepare to mate again. The period until the young leave the nest is 5-6 weeks. Once one of the chicks can be fed, you should separate all older babies because the baby would be feeding other chicks.

 

Remember that the budgie breeding process occurs when budgerigars have generous living conditions. First the budgerigar female lays eggs and the maturity is about 8-9 months. Generally, during budgie breeding we can see more affectivity between budgies. When budgerigar parakeet babies grow up they will be separated from their parents and then they will also be.-->
